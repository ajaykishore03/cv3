  <h3>Projects done</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Smart Energy Meter for solar inverter </li>
    <p> Worked as a student intern in Zunik Energies Pvt.Ltd <strong>IIT Roorkee</strong> for the accomplishment of my final year project .</p>
    <p>In the project I have developed the Arduino code for the user interface of the data which is going to be collected from the Solar Energy Inverter and that data will be tansfered to the android mobile by using the NODEMCU(ESP8266). The voltage
      sensor and the current sensor were designed using the Proteus siimulation software
      All this process is done wirelessly as we are using the NODEMCU chip and the android application was developed by using the MIT App inverter </p>
    <li>Simulation of Voltage Sag or Swell compensation using the Z-Source Inverter based on Dynamic Voltage Restorer</li>'
    <p>As we know the power is being transmitted from the source to the load in the mean time due to the effect of the impedence from the capacitor as well as the inductance there will be transmission losses because of which same amount of power
      which was generated doesn‚Äôt reach the load . To avoid this we are going to the Dynamic Voltage restorer which senses the effect of the SAG/ SWELL.
      The circuit has been designed by using the MATLAB Software . In the design of the circuit we are going to use the Z- Source Inverter which helps us reducing the harmonics by using the PIE filter .</p>
    '<li>Designing of Nano Capacitor</li>
    <li>Internship at BHEL</li>
